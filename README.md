# Hey!

Recently, I was a backend developer on my hackwestern hackathon submission [Medisight](https://github.com/harishuthaya/medisight) written in Python ✨. This whole journey began with an interest to learn more technologies. It started when I created something called [Martialis](https://github.com/aura0003/Martialis) 🤏. Before that, I was really into writing backend functions for various projects and hosting them on different cloud platforms.

> As a former Graphic Designer, I'll always have a soft spot for design. The space between development and design is where I thrive.
